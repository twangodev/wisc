# Read Previous Portfolios

## Prompt

To learn about your site and the experiences the previous UW students had there, you will read portfolios submitted by previous CS402 students.

- To learn about your site and the experiences the previous UW students had there, read the portfolios submitted for the previous semester for your site (SP24). You can find these portfolios in Canvas under Files / Sample Portfolios for a few past semesters.
- Pick at least one other portfolio to read through. Feel free to look through different semesters/years to get a good idea of experiences and feedback.
- Everyone should read two portfolios.

What to turn in: Answer the following questions using complete sentences; each of the four sets should be about one paragraph in length.

1. What exact two portfolios did you read? Give the two semester and club names.
2. What were three different things that seemed to work particularly well in previous semesters?  How can you replicate those aspects?
3. What were three different things that seemed to work poorly?  How can avoid those problems?
4. What did you find most surprising (or note worthy) about previous clubs?

You will be able to see other classmates reflections after you submit, feel free to (optionally) respond to ask questions or respond to your colleagues reflections.

## Response

1. Shorewood Spring 2024 and Goodman Community Center Spring 2024
2. Three things that went well that was mentioned in the reports from previous semesters include students growing not only in coding/problem-solving but also soft skills such as teamwork. They also mentioned how being able to adapt quickly to different students needs allowed them to create a better learning environment for everyone. Finally, adding the fun into coding made the learning experience very engaging and fun for the students. I'll try to replicate these aspects by being open-minded as I can and trying to get to know each student, so I can help them in a better manner. As for adding the fun, I'll try to make it feel not just like a class, but an environment where the students don't feel restricted.
3. Somethings that went poorly include some behavioural issues as expected from elementary students (especially during the beginning). This might be unavoidable at first but as the students become more familiar with us, it should get better. Another thing that didn't go well was engaging with all students equally. Some students are more shy than others, and as a result not engage as well as those who were not as shy. Again, just letting the students feel comfortable in a supportive environment would be something that would help with this. Finally, balancing fun/instruction. This is tricky, but creating a more hands-on and being less-focused on theory would hopefully have the students have more fun.
4. The two clubs I read are very different in terms of class sizes, Shorewood having 20+ kids while Goodman only having around 6 students. Yet the themes of what went well and what didn't go well shared significant overlap. I was expecting slightly differing things regarding what went well/poorly.
