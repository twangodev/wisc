- Where do you see Creative Learning in how you learn computer science?

You will be able to see other classmates reflections after you submit, feel free to (optionally) respond to ask questions or respond to your colleagues reflections.

## Response

Something exciting for me about creative learning and the 4 P's is how it reminds me of the creativity I put into my own projects. Each problem I encounter, whether it be CS or other day to day problems, there is typically a creative element about finding a proper solution. The 4 P's (Projects, Passion, Peers, and Play) are aspects that I deeply can relate to and it really does remind me of my childhood.

Some aspects I am unsure about the 4 P's is how its slightly faded away as I've climbed the education ladder. Stuff like rigorous exams and the competitiveness of school/society sometimes makes me forget about the 4 P's.

When I learn computer science, I can apply the creative learning process through trying and debugging different solutions. Sometimes stuff does work on the first try - and that's great. But when it doesn't, you often need to think outside the box and find creative solutions when it comes to solving problems within the field of CS. Stuff like trying a new library, new programming language, etc.
