# Parametric Form

!!! abstract
    - Learn how to write general solutions to a linear system in parametric vector form.
    - Understand geometrically the difference in the solution sets of $A\vec{x} = \vec{0}$ and $A\vec{x} = \vec{b}$ if $\vec{b} \neq \vec{0}$.

## Homogeneous Linear Systems

Homogeneous linear system is $A\vec{x} = \vec{0}$

The trivial solution to a homogeneous linear system is $\vec{x} = \vec{0}$.

### Parametric Vector Form

Given $A\vec{x} = \vec{0}$, the general solution can be written in parametric vector form as:

$$
\vec{x} = x_1\vec{v_1} + x_2\vec{v_2} + \ldots + x_n\vec{v_n}
$$

where $\vec{v_1}, \vec{v_2}, \ldots, \vec{v_n}$ are the basis vectors of the solution space.

The solution of $A\vec{x} = \vec{b}$ where $\vec{b} \neq \vec{0}$ is the sum of the particular solution and the general solution of the homogeneous system. This can be written as:

$$
\vec{x} = \vec{x_p} + \vec{x_h}
$$

where $\vec{x_p}$ is the particular solution (exactly one solution) and $\vec{x_h}$ is the general solution of the homogeneous system.
