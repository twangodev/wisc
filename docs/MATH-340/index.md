# Elementary Matrix and Linear Algebra

!!! warning "Disclaimer"
    I took this course in Fall 2024 and was unsatisfied with the lectures. Most of the notes are sourced from [UC Berkeley's Math 54][math-54] course, which covers the same content, in my opinion, in a more coherent and well-structured manner. I have, however, matched [Math 54][math-54] to the content of this course, so you can use the notes for this course as well.

## Course Description

An introduction to linear algebra. Topics include matrix algebra, linear systems of equations, vector spaces, sub-spaces, linear dependence, span, basis, rank of matrices, determinants, linear transformations, coordinate representations, kernel, range, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, diagonalization, inner products and orthogonal vectors, symmetric matrices. Covers linear algebra topics in greater depth and detail than MATH 320. Formal techniques in mathematical argument MATH 341 not covered.
