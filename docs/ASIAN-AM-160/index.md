# Asian American History: Movement and Dislocation

## Course Description

Over the course of the semester, we will untangle the many factors driving Asian immigration to the United States and explore how each wave of Asian immigration altered the social, political, cultural, and economic development of the nation from the mid-nineteenth century to the present. As non-white and non-European immigrants, Asian Americans grappled with the color line along with stereotypes that cast them as “forever foreign.” But the lived experiences of Asian Americans, far from revealing just the limits of American democracy, showcased efforts aimed at advancing American democracy to its fullest potential. Additionally, we will consider how Asian immigration connected the United States to the world and created transnational ties for Asian Americans.

## Ethnic Studies Requirement

History/Asian American Studies 160 is part of the University’s vibrant course array that fulfills the Ethnic Studies Requirement. By illuminating the circumstances, conditions, and experiences of racial and ethnic minorities in the United States, this “e” designated course advances three goals of the University:

- Better prepare students for life and careers in an increasingly multicultural environment
- Add breadth and depth to the University curriculum
- Improve campus climate

Additionally, this course fulfills the four Essential Learning Outcomes of the Ethnic Studies

**Requirement:**

- Awareness of History’s Impact on the Present - Ethnic Studies courses highlight how certain histories have been valued and devalued, and how these differences have promulgated disparities in contemporary American society.
- Ability to Recognize and Question Assumptions – Ethnic Studies courses promote recognition and application of critical thinking skills, specifically with respect to teaching students to harbor a healthy skepticism towards knowledge claims, whether in the form of media, political, or popular representations, primarily as these relate to race and ethnicity. As part of this process, the ESR should challenge students to question their own assumptions and preconceived notions on these topics.
- A Consciousness of Self and Other - Awareness of self is inextricably linked with awareness of and empathy towards the perspectives of others. In constructing a space for this kind of discussion in their classrooms, Ethnic Studies courses give students an opportunity to think about identity issues, including their own identity, as well as the connections they might have to people “outside” their focused social circle.
- Effective Participation in a Multicultural Society – Ethnic Studies courses should be relevant to students’ “lives outside the classroom,” and pursuing the objectives above should not only lead to student behavioral change, but to action in the real world. The ESR should ultimately engender in students the ability to participate in a multicultural society more effectively, respectfully, and meaningfully. This participation may be as mundane as being able to discuss race with a colleague or friend, or to recognize inequities in interpersonal, institutional, or other contexts.
