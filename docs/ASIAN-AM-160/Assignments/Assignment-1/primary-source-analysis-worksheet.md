# Primary Source Analysis Worksheet

1. Who is speaking?

    The pamphlet was issued by the American Federation of Labor (AFL), with contributions from prominent labor leaders such as Samuel Gompers. The AFL was advocating on behalf of American workers, framing the exclusion of Chinese laborers as a necessary measure to protect American jobs and uphold labor standards.

2. When was this pamphlet published?

    The pamphlet was originally published in 1902, during the 57th Congress of the United States. It was printed as Senate Document No. 137, and its publication coincided with the period when debates over extending the Chinese Exclusion Act were intensifying.

3. Who is the intended audience of this pamphlet?

    The intended audience was white American workers, particularly those in labor unions and working-class communities who felt threatened by the presence of Chinese immigrants in the workforce. It was also directed at policymakers and legislators to justify the exclusionary immigration laws. The AFL aimed to unite labor groups and influence public opinion, especially among those concerned about job competition and wage suppression.

4. What is the main purpose of this pamphlet?

    The main purpose of the pamphlet was to advocate for the continuation and strengthening of the Chinese Exclusion Act, by arguing that Chinese immigrants were undermining the economic welfare of American workers. The pamphlet used racial and economic arguments to frame Chinese laborers as a threat to American labor standards, claiming that their willingness to work for lower wages ("rice" vs. "meat") endangered the future of American manhood and the working class.

## Body Paragraph 1

Here are three reasons for the renewal of Chinese exclusion laws as advocated by groups like the American Federation of Labor (AFL) in their pamphlet *Some Reasons for Chinese Exclusion*:

1. Chinese laborers were portrayed as undercutting wages and threatening the jobs of American workers. The pamphlet argued that Chinese workers could survive on much lower wages ("rice" vs. "meat"), making it impossible for American workers to compete economically. This economic argument was a primary driver of exclusion renewal, as labor unions, particularly the AFL, sought to protect wages and job opportunities for white American workers.

2. The AFL and other proponents of exclusion framed the issue in terms of preserving the racial purity and moral standards of the United States. They argued that Chinese immigrants, described derogatorily as "coolies," were incompatible with American values and posed a threat to the nation's racial integrity and social fabric. This racist narrative was intended to fuel public fears of "Asiatic coolieism."

3. There was a fear that the presence of Chinese immigrants would weaken the strength and character of the American workforce. The pamphlet used the idea of protecting "American manhood" to evoke the image of Chinese immigrants as a threat to the nation’s future. By reinforcing the belief that Chinese immigrants were servile and unfit for citizenship, the AFL justified the need for continued exclusion to maintain American strength and independence.


## Body Paragraph 2

Silenced Perspective: Voices of Chinese laborers themselves

How does this perspective alter the debate on Chinese Exclusion?

1. Humanizing Chinese Immigrants and Recognizing their Contributions: By dismissing the perspective of Chinese immigrants, the AFL and other exclusionist groups denied the reality that many Chinese laborers made significant contributions to the development of the American economy, particularly in sectors like railroad construction, agriculture, and mining. Ronald Takaki's work in Strangers from a Different Shore highlights that Chinese laborers were instrumental in building the transcontinental railroad and in creating opportunities for U.S. economic expansion in the West. Acknowledging these contributions would challenge the notion that Chinese workers were merely "coolies" undermining the American workforce, thereby offering a more balanced view of their role in American society.
2. Challenging Racial Stereotypes and Economic Myths: The AFL framed Chinese laborers as willing to accept lower wages and as threats to "American manhood," but this obscured the structural inequalities and discriminatory practices Chinese immigrants faced, including being forced into low-wage jobs due to exclusion from many skilled labor markets. Eithne Luibheid's A Blueprint for Exclusion points out that many Chinese laborers accepted menial jobs because they were systematically barred from other professions . This exclusion created a distorted economic dynamic, which was used as justification for further discriminatory policies. Recognizing this context would alter the debate by focusing on systemic racism rather than scapegoating immigrant workers.

## Body Paragraph 3

Silenced Perspective: Role of Chinese women

How does this perspective alter the debate on Chinese Exclusion?

1. Impact on Family Formation and Stability: Judy Yung’s Unbound Feet highlights that Chinese exclusion laws directly hindered the ability of Chinese men to bring their families to the U.S., preventing family reunification and the growth of stable Chinese communities . Chinese women, particularly those who emigrated, were subjected to intense scrutiny and stereotyping as prostitutes, which reinforced a view that Chinese immigrants were morally inferior. This exclusion of women, and the subsequent barriers to family life, shifted the portrayal of Chinese immigrants as temporary laborers rather than potential citizens and long-term contributors to society. Recognizing this perspective would challenge the exclusionary argument that Chinese immigrants were inherently incapable of assimilation or family life in America.
2. Challenging the View of Chinese as a "Menace" to Society: By focusing solely on male laborers, exclusionists like the AFL framed Chinese immigrants as a threat to American economic and social life, often dehumanizing them in the process. However, by ignoring Chinese women and families, the exclusion debate left out the reality that many Chinese immigrants sought to establish roots in America and were active participants in community and family life. Eithne Luibheid’s A Blueprint for Exclusion discusses how Chinese women were essential in maintaining cultural continuity and resisting oppressive immigration practices . Including these voices would provide a more complex understanding of Chinese immigrants as community builders rather than solely laborers, undermining the AFL's portrayal of them as threats to American values.
