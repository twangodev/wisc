# Methods and Arrays

## Array Syntax

To create arrays in Java, you can use the following syntax:

```java
type[] arrayName = new type[size];
```

Accessing elements in an array is done using the following syntax:

```java
arrayName[index];
```

And retrieving the length of an array is done using the following syntax:

```java
arrayName.length;
```

## Perfect vs. Oversize Arrays

A perfect array is an array that is exactly the right size to hold all of the elements that you need to store.

An oversize array is an array that is larger than the number of elements that you need to store.
