# #1: Who is more intelligent, AI or I?

## Rough Draft Prompt

Artificial Intelligence (AI) Large Language Models (LLM) like ChatGPT are here to stay, and many aspects of life will be transformed by them. Perhaps most importantly, the way we write will be changed in substantial ways. This presents benefits, pitfalls, and real dangers. As you maneuver this new playing field, it is critical that you stay ahead of the many rapid changes. One of the key things to realize: The rules of good writing have not changed. Just because ChatGPT can research and write on a topic does not mean that the result is good writing, and that its anwers are correct.

So, before we write about actual course-related topics in Astronomy 236 (using ChatGPT or similar tools as appropriate in the process), we will use this first writing assignment to experiment with, reflect on, and strategize about using LLMs in our writing. Please research and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of LLM, providing examples where possible (e.g., try to make ChatGPT et al. to generate incorrect or bad writing, challenge its answers and see what happens, etc.). Then define your own approach of how you plan to use them going forward (if at all), given the state of the art in LLM at the time of this assignment. Finally, discuss how you think LLM will change the process of writing within our society and within science and conclude with your own personal opinion about where AI and society are headed.

You are explicitly encouraged to use ChatGPT (free version) or similar AILMs in this project. As with all other resources, you must provide proper credit and attribution. That is, add quotations and end notes that reference the source. If you include text that was generated (or partly generated and then edited by you), include an end-node that shows the prompt used to generate the text (you don't have to include the entire chat history.) We are all working on optimizing our ChatGPT workflows, so sharing good practices will be helpful for others.

Submit your first draft by 09/14 in Canvas. End notes, references, and other parenthetical material should be submitted in a second document (upload as a text or pdf file) or provided in the end notes below your main document (in this case, the word count provided by the editor will not be correct, as it will include the end notes; please ensure that the main text does not exceed the word limit.) Please ensure to stay within the 2000 word limit (the editor in Canvas provides a word count.)

This assignment includes anonymous peer review by two of your classmates. Meanwhile, you will peer-review the drafts of two other classmates that will be assigned to you randomly. We will go over the details of this process in next week’s assignment and in class. Your peer review entries will be due on 09/21 in Canvas. You will also receive editing suggestions from the instructors. We will also provide feedback to the peer reviewers about their review. As always, ensure that your peer reviews are constructive and respectful. They are meant to review the writing first and foremost, though you need to highlight obvious factual inaccuracies. Peer review rubrics will be provided separately.

Finally, you will have the opportunity to revise and resubmit your draft.
