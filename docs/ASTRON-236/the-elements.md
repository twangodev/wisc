# The Elements

- People originally thought that the elements were earth, air, fire, and water. (Aristotle)
- Eventually, scientists discovered that elements are actually made up of unique atoms.
    - Motive originated from the question of how to make gold from other elements.
- Unique atoms were thought to just be spheres, but they were later discovered to have a nucleus and electrons.

## Atomic Spectroscopy

Hydrogen lamp:

- Electricity passes through hydrogen gas causes gas to emit light
- At one specific wavelength, the light is very bright

### Atomic Lines

- Emission and absorption lines
    - Each chemical elements has unique energy levels
    - Like a fingerprint (or barcode): Observe absorption or emission lines and identity the element responsible

- Can be used to determine the composition of stars, planets, etc.

### Structure of Atoms

How might we find out about the structure of atoms?

## Nucleus

Rutherford (1911) - Gold foil experiment

- Sent alphas through thin gold foil
- Most went through: consistent with Plum Pudding model
- A few scattered of something heavy: inconsistent with Plum Pudding model
- Ergo: Rutherford discovered the nucleus

## The Atom
Atoms are made of:
- A positively charged nucleus
- Negatively charged electrons

Opposite electric charges attract
- Electrons are held near the nucleus by electrostatic force
