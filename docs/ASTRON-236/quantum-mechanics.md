# Quantum Mechanics

## The Atom

- Photoelectric effect:
    - UV light shining on electrode releases electrons
    - Red light does not release electrons, regardless of the amount of light
    - Conclusion: Light comes in packets of energy (quanta)
- Electrons changing energy levels in atoms emit light at specific wavelengths
    - The light (electromagnetic radiation) is released in short bursts
    - Each short burst is called a photon

- We see these photos as emission at specific wavelengths
- Each atom has a set of specific wavelenghts
- Each atom has a fixed set of energies electrons can have
- The energy of electrons are quantized

## Quantum Mechanics vs. Classical Mechanics

- Newton invented calculus to derive the laws of motion
- Mechanics: The branch of physics that deals with:
    - The action of forces on bodies
    - Motion

    $$
    f = ma
    $$

- Classic mechanics matches our experience and intuition
- However, it completely breaks down when applied to the sub-microscopic world (the world of atoms)


### Energy
Energy is a quantity measuring the ability of something to do work
- It cannot be created or destroyed, but it can change/take different forms
    - Potential energy
    - Kinetic energy
    - Thermal energy

## Semi-Classics

- Plank and Einstein
    - Light must come in energy packets called photos
    - Energy of a photon is proportional to its frequency

    $$
    E = h\nu
    $$

- Niels Bohr
    - Electrons orbit nucleus like planets orbit Sun
        - Instead of gravity, it's electrostatic force that pulls electrons to nucleus
    - But: Only certain orbits are allowed
        - Electrons closer to nucleus have lower energy
    - Classically, such an atom is not stable (electrons spiral in)

## Probabilities

- The quantum world is a world off probabilities

### Schr√∂dinger's Equation

$$
i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}\Psi + V\Psi
$$

### The Wave Equation

$$
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}\Psi = c^2\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}\Psi
$$
