# The History of Matter in the Universe

## Course Description

This is a multidisciplinary study of how the distribution of elements in the Universe has changed over cosmic time by tracing the history of matter from the Big Bang to the formation and evolution of the Solar System, ultimately leading to conditions conducive to the existence of human life on Earth and the formation of other habitable planets. The course will emphasize connections between astronomy, geology, and chemistry and will touch aspects of philosophy. Readings will draw both on scientific literature and the popular press to allow us to engage with the material on multiple levels.
