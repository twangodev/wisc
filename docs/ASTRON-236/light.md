# Light

Electromagnetic radiation

## Radiation

Form of energy

- Moves around at the speed of light
- Energy in the form of both electric and magnetic fields

## Wave or Particle?

- Both!
- Light can act as a wave or a particle
- Wave-particle duality

## Electromagnetic Spectrum

- Shorter wavelengths have higher energy/frequency

## Blackbody Radiation

On object can be transparent or opaque

- Opaque object absort and block radiation from hitting them
- Transparent objects allow radiation to pass through

### Blackbody Spectrum

- Hotter things are "bluer", colder things are "redder"
- Hotter things are always brighter er at all wavelengths
